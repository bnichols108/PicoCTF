Explanation: This was caused by the variables in the C programming language have a fixed set of memory addresses. Because I input a large number, it caused an overflow of the integer which created a negative number. "This type in a 4 bytes and 2's complement implementation have a range of [â€“2,147,483,648, 2,147,483,647]. Your overflow is undefined behaviour." Then once the math was calculated in the logic, it seemed like I had a large balance, which allowed me to buy the 1337 flag which led to the flag for this challenge.
